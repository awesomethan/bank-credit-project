For this project, I collaborated with my friends Ansh and Jess to make a credit card approval prediction site. I worked on the front end using React JS and CSS, Ansh used Flask to create the back end, and Jess helped improve the back end and integrate the React and Flask files. In short, this site asks the user for personal information and determines whether he/she is eligible to apply for a credit card.
