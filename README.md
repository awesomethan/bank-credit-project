For this project, I collaborated with my friends Ansh and Jess to make a credit card approval prediction site. Jess and I worked on creating and designing the front end using React JS and CSS, and we also integrated the React and Flask files; Ansh used Flask to create the back end. In short, this site asks the user for personal information and determines whether he/she is eligible to apply for a credit card.
